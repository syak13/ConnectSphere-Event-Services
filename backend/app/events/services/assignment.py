Coordinator Assignment
-----------------------
- Automatic coordinator assignment on submission (fair, workload-based;
  exactly one Coordinator per event, no self-assign / accept-decline step)
- Coordinator views assigned requests (routes.py)
- Reassign coordinator after offline agreement
- Coordinators view unassigned/all events for planning visibility (routes.py)
- Previous coordinator retains read-only visibility after reassignment
