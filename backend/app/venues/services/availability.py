"""Venue Availability Calendar epic.

Week 7 change #1 (Venue Setup and Turnaround Time): a venue's effective
busy window is no longer just the event's advertised start/end -- it is
padded by the venue's setup_minutes before and turnaround_minutes after.
compute_booking_window() is the single source of truth for this and is
reused by booking.py's conflict detection so the two can never drift apart.
